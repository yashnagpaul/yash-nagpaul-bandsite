            Xavier De Ronsay and Gaspard Augé had a few mutual friends, who
            happened to run a record label, seeking tracks for a compilation.
            With an immediate connection, the pair decided to try their hand at
            making a song. That’s when they created their breakout single, We
            Are Your Friends – a feel-good, funk-filled, instant anthem that
            lost the remix contest, but won the attention of Pedro Winter,
            director of the newly founded Ed Banger Records, who boasted Daft
            Punk as former clients. One week later, they were in his office,
            signing a record deal.
